# Google CloneðŸ‘¾
This project was created in the tecnolochicas PRO bootcamp as an HTML5 and CSS3 practice. 

## Description
This project is a replica of the Google main page using only HTML and CSS. 
The goal was to practice using these tools to recreate the primary components of a web page. The project does not have any functionality beyond displaying the static content of the Google main page. By replicating this popular web page, we gained experience in using HTML and CSS to create visually appealing web pages.

## Result
